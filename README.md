# E-Commerce Data Analysis Project

## Overview
Welcome to the E-Commerce Data Analysis Project! This project represents my individual endeavor to dissect and derive insights from e-commerce data, leveraging my expertise in Business Intelligence System Infrastructure. Through this project, I aimed to demonstrate my proficiency in data analysis and strategic decision-making.

## Project Objectives
The primary objective of this individual project was to meticulously analyze e-commerce data and extract actionable insights to drive strategic decision-making. With full autonomy over the project scope and execution, I set out to optimize data processes, develop insightful dashboards, and present findings to senior stakeholders.

## Project Duration
From January 2024 to April 2024, I dedicated myself to this project, investing time and effort to deliver impactful results. This individual undertaking allowed me to showcase my skills and demonstrate my ability to drive value through data-driven analysis.

## Key Contributions
### Enhanced Data Accuracy
One of the main achievements of this project was the substantial improvement in data accuracy. By processing over 1 million data points using Power Query, I achieved a remarkable 30% enhancement in data accuracy, paving the way for more reliable decision-making processes.

### Optimized Report Performance
To ensure that reports were not just reliable but also efficient, I engineered a dimensional data model in Power BI. This optimization of report performance facilitated quicker and more reliable data analysis, empowering stakeholders with timely and accurate insights.

### Strategic Dashboard Development
My strategic dashboards, crafted in Power BI with DAX-generated measures, played a pivotal role in influencing strategic decisions. By providing in-depth analysis of sales metrics and customer feedback, these dashboards empowered stakeholders to make data-driven decisions that drove business growth.

### Stakeholder Engagement
Effective communication of findings to senior stakeholders was paramount. By articulately presenting insights, I catalyzed the initiation of three strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing customer satisfaction and boosting sales by an impressive 20%.

## Tools and Technologies Used
My toolkit comprised cutting-edge tools and technologies:
- Power Query: For meticulous data processing and transformation.
- Power BI: For visually stunning data visualization and dashboard development.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For sophisticated calculations and measures within Power BI.

## Future Work
While this project has yielded commendable results, there's always room for further refinement and innovation. Future endeavors could include refining predictive models, exploring additional data sources, and implementing advanced analytics techniques to unlock deeper insights and drive continued business success.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the E-Commerce Data Analysis Project underscores my capabilities as an individual practitioner in the field of business intelligence and analytics. Through this project, I've demonstrated my ability to drive value, make informed decisions, and deliver impactful results through data-driven analysis.
