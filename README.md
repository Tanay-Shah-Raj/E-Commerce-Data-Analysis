# E-Commerce Data Analysis

This project analyzes e-commerce data to extract actionable insights and drive strategic decisions. It showcases my expertise in Business Intelligence and data analysis.

## Objectives
- **Analyze E-Commerce Data**: Extract insights to enhance strategic decision-making.
- **Improve Data Quality**: Enhance data accuracy by 30% using Power Query on over 1 million data points.
- **Optimize Reporting**: Develop a dimensional data model in Power BI for faster and more reliable reports.
- **Develop Strategic Dashboards**: Create Power BI dashboards with DAX measures to highlight key metrics and catalyze business growth.
- **Engage Stakeholders**: Present findings that led to three strategic initiatives, boosting sales by 20%.

## Methodology
The project followed a systematic approach to transform raw e-commerce data into valuable business insights:

- **Data Assessment and Collection**: Evaluated available data sources and identified key metrics relevant to business objectives. Collected data from multiple systems including CRM, ERP, and web analytics platforms.

- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Applied Power Query transformations to standardize formats, remove duplicates, and handle missing values. Created a robust ETL process to ensure data consistency and reliability.

- **Dimensional Modeling**: Designed a star schema data model with fact and dimension tables to optimize query performance and analytical capabilities. Established proper relationships and hierarchies to enable multi-level analysis.

- **Measure Development**: Created complex DAX measures to calculate KPIs including customer lifetime value, basket analysis metrics, and year-over-year performance comparisons.

- **Visualization Design**: Applied data visualization best practices to create intuitive dashboards that effectively communicate insights through appropriate chart types and visual hierarchies.

## Duration
**January 2024 â€“ April 2024**

## Tools and Technologies
- **Power Query**: Data processing and transformation.
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **DAX**: Complex calculations and measures in Power BI.

## Results and Observations
The analysis revealed several key insights:

- Customer segments with the highest lifetime value were identified, enabling more targeted marketing campaigns
- Geographic analysis uncovered untapped market opportunities in specific regions
- Product affinity analysis led to improved recommendation algorithms and cross-selling strategies
- Seasonal buying patterns were identified, allowing for optimized inventory management
- Shopping cart abandonment analysis revealed friction points in the checkout process

These insights directly contributed to the 20% sales increase through strategic initiatives focused on customer retention, market expansion, and user experience improvements.
